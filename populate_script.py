A relative of the herring, they are a short-lived, schooling fish feeding on small fry (recently hatched fish) and plankton at the bottom of the food-chain. As an oily fish, their strong flavour is used to add a kick to many dishes and sauces, including Worcestershire Sauce, and they are widely used in Mediterranean cooking.",

It's rumoured to improve brain power so an ideal starter fish for the kids! A fast swimming silver and blue striped fish belonging to a group of fish called Scombrids, it's related to tuna.

Their firm white meat is similar in taste and texture to bass and is ideal for grilling, steaming, baking and pan-frying whole. Black bream or porgy are commonly found in northern European seas and are commercially fished. However the bulk of the seabream in the UK market comes from imports of Mediterranean farmed gilthead bream. Black bream is a pretty inexpensive fish to eat as it's not massively popular despite the fact it's delicious. Its taste is distinctive and on the sweet side so best grilled or stuffed and baked whole (after removing its scales).",

As with all shellfish, except shrimp, mussels should be checked to ensure they are still alive just before they are cooked; enzymes quickly break down the meat and make them unpalatable or poisonous after dying or uncooked. Some mussels might contain toxins. A simple criterion is that live mussels, when in the air, will shut tightly when disturbed. Open, unresponsive mussels are dead, and must be discarded.",

         "description": "Salmon is an oily fish rich in Omega 3. It's a good source of Vitamin D, phosphorous and calcium. Fresh salmon may be baked, grilled or poached. It is also canned, pickled (gravadlax) or smoked. It's also used as a substitute for sushi and in sashimi. Generally stocks of wild Atlantic salmon are depleted. There may be several reasons for this. Factors include: marine mortality, linked to ocean climate and productivity; pollution; environmental changes; aquaculture; freshwater habitat deterioration; and impediments to migration routes. Due to their migratory behaviour it is difficult to effectively manage individual populations. ICES scientists recommend that fishing for salmon only takes place in rivers where stocks are at full reproductive capacity or above conservation limits. Avoid eating wild-caught salmon from rivers below these limits.",

They are widely thought to be baby herring and are usually sold frozen. The term whitebait is used widely throughout the world, referring to small, usually marine, fishes. It has been reported that whitebait available in the UK is made up mostly of young sprats from the Baltic Sea, but depending on the source, these may be mixed with the young of shad, herrings, sticklebacks, gobies and shrimps.",
